Sure! Hereâ€™s a sample README.md for your Arduino project that uses servo motors and pressure sensors.

# Servo Motor Control with Pressure Sensors

This project controls five servo motors based on readings from pressure sensors. When the conductive fabric is pressed, the corresponding servo motor moves to a specified angle and then returns to its original position.

## Components

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- 5 Servo motors
- 5 Pressure sensors (connected to analog pins)
- Conductive fabric
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Diagram

```
[Connect the servo motors to digital pins 9 to 13]
[Connect the pressure sensors to analog pins A0 to A4]
```

## Code Overview

The code initializes five servo motors and reads values from five pressure sensors. When a sensor's value exceeds a defined threshold, the corresponding servo motor moves to a specified angle. After a short delay, it returns to its original position.

### Code Breakdown

- **Libraries**: The `Servo` library is included to control the servo motors.
- **Variables**:
  - `servos[]`: An array to hold servo objects.
  - `sensorPins[]`: An array containing the analog pins for pressure sensors.
  - `angle[]` and `originalAngle[]`: Arrays to store current and original angles of the servos.
  - `threshold`: The minimum sensor value required to trigger a servo movement.
  - `moveAngle`: The angle to which the servo moves when triggered.

### Functions

- `setup()`: Initializes the serial communication and attaches the servo motors to their respective pins.
- `loop()`: Continuously reads sensor values and moves the corresponding servo motor if the pressure exceeds the threshold.

### Usage

1. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. Connect the servo motors and pressure sensors as per the circuit diagram.
3. Press the conductive fabric to trigger the servo motors.

### Example Output

When a sensor is activated, the following messages will appear in the serial monitor:
```
Servo 0 moved to angle: 30
Servo 0 returned to angle: 0
```

## Requirements
